I found out that the trips decrase by 30% in Q4 from October to December 2020.
68% of the trips are made from male.
And the female ridership decrease across time.
Female's trips are longer in time and distance than male's and rides froms younger people (15-25) last more than older people.
The pick hour is in the afternoon at 5pm.
